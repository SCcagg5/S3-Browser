# Integration test stack

This directory contains an isolated SeaweedFS object-storage service and the browser configuration used by smoke tests.

The SeaweedFS service is one process: it has the master, the volume server, the filer and the S3 API. `seaweedfs/Dockerfile` downloads the release 4.41 and checks its SHA-256 checksum. This version is the one of the Home repository. `seaweedfs/scripts/entrypoint.sh` creates the identity and the buckets `default` and `archive` from `config.hcl`. It also creates the bucket `locked` with Object Lock (`s3.bucket.create -withLock`), and then writes a ready file for the health check.

`config.hcl` defines one S3 authentication shared by two buckets. Each bucket has its own permission ceiling and navigation scan limit.

The browser container:

- uses the HCL file read-only;
- runs with a read-only root filesystem;
- has no application data volume;
- retains jobs and upload sessions only in process memory;
- must start when a provider returns HTTP 501 for version listing.

Start the stack:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8080/
```

To expose the application under `/s3-browser/`, configure the reverse proxy to remove that prefix before forwarding. The frontend resolves all URLs relative to the public document path and requires no HCL path setting.

The fixed credentials in `config.hcl` and `secrets/` belong only to the isolated SeaweedFS service. Do not reuse them outside this test environment. The secret key is in `secrets/s3_secret_access_key`, because the browser refuses a secret in clear text in the HCL file. The compose file mounts `secrets/` at `/config/secrets` in both containers.

## Portal test stack: three providers

`portal-frontend/compose.yaml` starts three S3 providers next to S3-Browser. `portal-frontend/run.sh` starts the stack, puts the test objects and runs the browser tests. Refer to [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](../docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#browser-tests-of-the-portal-frontend).

| Provider | Image | Instance | Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SeaweedFS 4.41 | `seaweedfs/Dockerfile`: the release archive, with its SHA-256 checksum | `seaweedfs-main`, `seaweedfs-archive`, `seaweedfs-locked`, `seaweedfs-encrypted` | `http://seaweedfs:8333` |
| MinIO RELEASE.2025-10-15T17-29-55Z | `minio/Dockerfile`: a build from the Git tag, with a check of its commit | `minio-main`, `minio-locked`, `minio-encrypted` | `http://minio:9000` |
| Garage v2.4.1 | `garage/Dockerfile`: the binary of `dxflrs/garage:v2.4.1`, pinned by its digest | `garage-main`, `garage-encrypted` | `http://garage:3900` |

The MinIO project does not publish a server image or a server binary now, and its repository is archived. Thus `minio/Dockerfile` builds the last release from source. The build takes about one minute, one time. Docker keeps the image in its cache.

Each provider reads the first `access_key_id` and the first `secret_access_key_file` of `portal-frontend/config.hcl`. Thus the three `auth` blocks use the same key. Garage needs this format: `GK` and 24 hexadecimal characters for the key ID, 64 hexadecimal characters for the secret. Each entrypoint creates the bucket `default` and then writes a ready file. The entrypoints of SeaweedFS and MinIO also create the bucket `locked` with Object Lock. A bucket gets Object Lock only at its creation (`x-amz-bucket-object-lock-enabled: true`). Object Lock turns on its versioning. Garage cannot make a bucket with Object Lock. The instances `seaweedfs-locked` and `minio-locked` of `portal-frontend/config.hcl` use these buckets, and `portal-frontend/providers.js` lists them in `LOCKED`. The health check of each provider reads this file, so the browser starts after the buckets exist. The Garage region is `garage`.

The seed (`portal-frontend/seed.js`) enables the versioning of the bucket `default` on SeaweedFS and MinIO. It puts the same objects in `smoke/` on each provider: one file with tags where the provider has tags, and one file with two versions. On SeaweedFS, the seed also puts the data of the other tests: files with several versions in `versions/`, tags, a lifecycle rule, and a JSON file, a CSV file and a binary file for the comparison. The other browser tests use SeaweedFS only.

The image of S3-Browser in this stack copies in parts from 8 KiB up, in parts of 5 MiB (the build arguments `MULTIPART_COPY_THRESHOLD` and `MULTIPART_COPY_PART_SIZE` of `browser/Dockerfile`). The seed puts `copy/source.bin` (11 MiB, three parts) with standard headers, a user metadata and tags on each provider. On SeaweedFS and MinIO, it also puts `copy/versioned.bin` with two versions. The tests of the copy in parts copy and rename `source.bin` through the page and compare the SHA-256, the headers and the tags. They also restore the older version of `versioned.bin`.

The seed also puts the objects of the metadata tests in `meta/` on each provider: `small.txt` (under the threshold of the copy in parts), `large.bin` (20000 bytes, above it) and `conflict.txt`, each with `Cache-Control: max-age=60` and the user metadata `owner`. `small.txt` and `large.bin` have tags where the provider has them. `versioned.txt` has two versions on SeaweedFS and MinIO. The metadata tests edit these objects through the details on each provider. They check each sentence that the form shows before the save against the result: the date, the ETag, the versions and the tags. They also check that the form shows and sends the stored `Cache-Control`, not the value of the gateway (`private, no-store, max-age=60`). Refer to the section "Edit of the metadata" of [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

The seed also puts four incomplete multipart uploads in `mpu/` on each provider, with S3 requests: `one-part.bin` (one part of 1 KiB), `no-part.bin`, and two uploads of `twice.bin`. The folder has `readme.txt`, so the page can open it. The test of each provider opens the window "Incomplete uploads" of the folder. It checks the parts, the age ("unknown" on SeaweedFS) and "Abort everything older than 1 day", which aborts nothing. It then aborts one upload of `twice.bin` with "Abort selected" and `one-part.bin` with the button of its row. The test aborts the last two uploads through the API. A second test starts a resumable upload through the API and checks that the window and the server do not abort it. Refer to the section "Cleanup of incomplete multipart uploads" of [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

The tests of the lifecycle editor write the rules of the bucket `default` through the S3 API of each provider first (`portal-frontend/s3.js`). At the end, each test writes the rule of the seed again on SeaweedFS and deletes the rules on MinIO and Garage: the tests of the tags read the rule of SeaweedFS. The test of each provider adds a rule through the window, with the confirmation of the deletion. It checks that the rule with a date stays byte for byte, and that the window offers only the fields that the provider keeps. A second test opens the window from the window "Incomplete uploads" with the rule that aborts the uploads, where the provider keeps it. Other tests check a change of the rules while the window is open, the changes of the provider after a save, a read-only editor, and the hidden item.

The tests of Object Lock use the instances `seaweedfs-locked` and `minio-locked`. Each test makes its own object with a unique key. The first test makes two versions, because the details show the version picker only for a file with two versions or more. It sets a legal hold on the current version through the details, and tries to delete this version with the Delete button of the picker. It reads the message that names the lock, removes the hold and deletes the version. A second test extends a Governance retention, and shortens it with the confirmation of the bypass. A third test checks that the page and the server refuse to shorten a Compliance retention. The retentions end after a few seconds, and each test then deletes its version: a run leaves no locked version. `run.sh` also removes the volumes of the stack after each run. A test checks that the section is hidden on `garage-main` and on the buckets without Object Lock. On each locked bucket, a test deletes a file and a folder through the page. The confirmation and a warning say that the locked version stays, and the version stays behind a delete marker. A bucket without Object Lock has no such sentence. Refer to the section "Object Lock" of [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

SeaweedFS and MinIO really encrypt with SSE-S3 in this stack. The entrypoint of SeaweedFS gives the S3 server a random key encryption key (`WEED_S3_SSE_KEK`, 32 bytes in hexadecimal). The entrypoint of MinIO gives it a random KMS key (`MINIO_KMS_SECRET_KEY`, `s3-browser-test:` and 32 bytes in base64). Each start makes new keys. They stay in the environment of the process: no file, no log, no output. The data of the stack does not outlive its containers. Both entrypoints also create the bucket `encrypted`. The instances `seaweedfs-encrypted` and `minio-encrypted` use it with `encryption = "sse-s3"`, and `portal-frontend/providers.js` lists them in `ENCRYPTED`. The instance `garage-encrypted` uses the bucket `default` of Garage with `encryption = "sse-s3"`. Two instances can use the same bucket. The seed enables the versioning of the buckets `encrypted`. It puts `enc/customer-key.txt` with a key of the client (SSE-C) on SeaweedFS and Garage, with a random key that only the seed process knows. It also puts `enc/kms.txt` with SSE-KMS on MinIO.

The tests of the encryption upload a file through the page to each encrypted instance, in one request and in parts. They copy, rename, move, copy in parts, edit the metadata (also in parts) and restore an older version. Each source is not encrypted. After each operation, the HEAD request on the provider says `AES256`, and the details say "SSE-S3 (AES256)". On MinIO, a metadata edit and a restore keep `aws:kms` and its key. Other tests put a default encryption on the bucket `default` of SeaweedFS and MinIO, check the row "Bucket default", and remove it. They also check the details of the SSE-KMS and SSE-C objects. On Garage, an upload to `garage-encrypted` works, the object has no encryption, and the details show no encryption section.

Other tests of the encryption check the preview, the link to the original and the downloads of the SSE-C object: they give the message of the key of the client. A HEAD answer `400` of an other object stays an error. The bucket selector shows a key for `seaweedfs-encrypted` and `minio-encrypted`, a key in the colour of a warning for `garage-encrypted`, and no key for the other instances. The listing shows a key next to an encrypted file by default on each instance (SSE-S3, SSE-C, SSE-KMS). The setting goes off for one bucket and stays in the browser. A test with 120 files counts the HEAD requests: 4 at the same time, 100 files at most, one request for each file. A test writes a version without encryption and a version with SSE-S3 of one key, and checks the marks of the preview and the details of each version. Refer to the section "Encryption" of [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

On `seaweedfs-locked` and `minio-locked`, a test writes files with a legal hold, a Governance retention, a Compliance retention, a past retention, no lock, and SSE-S3 with a lock. The listing and the preview show the padlock with the right tooltip, and the key and the padlock for the last file. The bucket selector shows the padlock of the bucket. The setting stops the marks. The test counts one HEAD request for each file and no request of `/api/object-lock`. The Compliance retention has 45 seconds, and the test waits for its end before it deletes the versions.

Each provider gives the usage and the quota of its buckets in its admin API, and each `auth` block of `portal-frontend/config.hcl` has a `usage` block. The entrypoints give the bucket `default` of each provider a quota of 20 GiB, a large value that no test reaches. Garage also gets a quota of 100000 objects. The Garage entrypoint sets it with `garage bucket set-quotas`, SeaweedFS with `s3.bucket.quota` in `weed shell` (not enforced), and MinIO with `PUT /minio/admin/v3/set-bucket-quota` (a hard quota). The admin API of Garage listens on port 3903 of the network of the stack. Its admin token is a test value in `secrets/garage_admin_token`: the entrypoint and the `token_file` of the browser read the same file. The browser reads the master (port 9333) and the filer (port 8888) of SeaweedFS, and the admin API of MinIO on its S3 endpoint with the root key. The instance `seaweedfs-archive` has `quota_bytes = 10737418240` (10 GiB): its bucket has no quota at the provider. The other buckets have no quota.

The tests of the usage check the usage in the facts of the bucket selector on each provider: the used bytes, `of 20 GB`, the bar, the tooltip and the `~` of SeaweedFS and MinIO. They also check a bucket without a quota (`used`), the limit of `quota_bytes`, an instance without usage (no request of `/api/usage`), and a failed read (no number, the reason in the tooltip, no notice). On Garage and SeaweedFS, a test uploads 3 MiB and waits until the number grows. MinIO counts in a scan of about one minute, so its growth is not tested. Other tests check the tooltips of the bucket selector, the pills of the details and the sections that close.

The tests of the facts of the bucket selector check each provider: Garage shows the usage only. On `seaweedfs-locked`, the facts are the padlock, the rules and the usage, and the versioning icon follows the permission icons. The encrypted buckets show the key, and Garage shows it in the colour of a warning. Each bucket of the list has its facts from `/api/instances`: the seed turns on versioning and adds a rule after the start, so the test waits until the server reads them again (60 seconds at most). The page reads the usage of the buckets 4 at a time, with "…" while a read waits. The chip of the lifecycle rules opens the window of the rules with the mouse and the keyboard.

The tests of the layout of the header and of the selector measure them at 14 widths from 320 to 1920 px, with a fine and a coarse pointer. The header is one row of 45 px, the height of the header of ClickHouse Dash, with a tolerance of 1 px (57 px on a coarse pointer). Its controls have one vertical centre within 2 px, and the page has no horizontal scroll. The trigger is one row of 28 px (44 px) on five instances, on a long name with every fact and a full bucket, on one visible bucket and on a failed read of the usage. A test checks the order in which a narrow selector drops its facts, and the facts in the tooltip. Each bucket and each host of the list is one line, a root prefix follows its name, and the list has the edges of the trigger. The versioning icon is within 12 px of the delete icon, and Garage has none. The bar of the preview page is one row at each width; a comparison keeps one row from 761 px.

The tests of a full bucket answer `/api/usage` with `page.route`: 91 %, 100 % and 50 % of the limit, and a bucket without a limit of bytes. They check the banner, its `role="alert"`, its texts, the marks of the selector, the mark of another full bucket and the tooltip of the upload button. The real usage of the test stack gives no warning. A test of the details checks that Storage object and Tags are side by side at 1440 px, and one under the other at 390 px.

A test opens each menu of the portal in the two themes: the theme menu, the list of the buckets, the menus Actions and settings, a menu of a row, the suggestions of the metadata editor, and on the preview page the theme menu, the menu of the actions and the version picker. The background of each menu has an alpha of 1, the menu has an opacity of 1 in the first frame of its animation, and no element of the page is over it.

Other tests check the settings menu: no part is wider than the menu at 390 and 1280 px. They check the columns that are on by default on `seaweedfs-main` and `garage-main`, and the saved choices. They also check the listing without totals, and the permission icons of the selector with the mouse, Enter and Space.

The browser tests start each page with all the sections of the details open (the choice that the browser keeps in `portal.details.sections`). The tests of the sections start with the default: "Storage object" and "Tags" open, the other sections closed.

The smoke test of each provider lists `smoke/`, uploads a file with its SHA-256 checksum, downloads it and deletes it. It checks the versions and the tags where the provider has them. Where the provider does not have them, it checks that the page hides them. `portal-frontend/providers.js` has the flags of each provider.

## Functions of each provider

These facts come from S3 requests to the three providers of the portal test stack, with a check of the effect by a second request. "Yes" means that the request works and has its effect. "Dropped" means that the provider answers 200 but does not keep the setting. Other cells give the HTTP status and the S3 error code.

Notes for the code:

- Garage answers 501 NotImplemented for each function that it does not have. The message is `Unimplemented action: <name>`.
- Do not send a `versionId` to Garage. Garage gives an `x-amz-version-id` header on each write, but it keeps no versions.
- Garage drops some lifecycle settings with no error. After a write, read the configuration again and compare it.
  The lifecycle editor offers only the fields that each provider keeps. Refer to the section "Edit of the lifecycle
  rules" of [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Delete the lifecycle configuration with `DeleteBucketLifecycle`: MinIO and Garage refuse a configuration with no rule.
- Send `Content-MD5` or an `x-amz-checksum-*` header with DeleteObjects: MinIO refuses the request without one.
- On MinIO, list the multipart uploads with no prefix. Then S3-Browser filters the keys.
- The lock refusal codes are different: 403 AccessDenied on SeaweedFS, 400 InvalidRequest on MinIO. The bypass header does not remove a legal hold or a Compliance retention. After such a refusal, read the lock of the version: the code alone does not tell a lock from a missing permission.
- A delete with no `versionId` in a bucket with Object Lock writes a delete marker. Only the delete of a version can meet a lock.
- SSE-S3 needs a key service: a KEK for SeaweedFS (`WEED_S3_SSE_KEK`, or `s3.sse.kek` in `security.toml`), a KMS for MinIO. Without it, the write fails. Garage accepts the header and does not encrypt: S3-Browser writes a warning at start for a Garage bucket with `encryption = "sse-s3"`.
- A copy without `x-amz-server-side-encryption` loses the SSE-S3 of its source on SeaweedFS and MinIO. Send the header with each copy.
